# C-Sharp-InheritBaseMethods
Inherit Base Methods from a derived class, to save writing out loads of code.

Lines 91 - 95 show the new faster code, I called a Base class method, from my derived class, to save writing out lines of code AGAIN. 

This is the line I'm talking about:
base.displayFullName(); //calling the base method, to save writing out all the code again.

"Base" is my main object that holds the method.
